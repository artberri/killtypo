# KillTypo

The Progressive Web App To Practice Typing. [https://www.killtypo.com/](https://www.killtypo.com/)

## What is this about?

KillTypo [https://www.killtypo.com/](https://www.killtypo.com/) is a project started by
[Alberto Varela](http://www.berriart.com) in order to learn about [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
and [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). I believe
that creating a real project eases the knowledge retention and helps understanding the new
technologies when you are learning, and that's why I created KillTypo.

I know that there is room to improve this code and that it's far from being a perfect Progressive
Web Application, that's why I think that is worth to publish the source code and share it with
everybody, now, you can help me doing it better.

Feel free to contribute.
